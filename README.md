First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Key Features

1. User Authentication: Users can securely log in to the application using their GitHub account credentials.

2. Todo Creation: Users can easily create new todos by providing a title and description for each task. The application ensures that all todos are stored in the MongoDB database for persistence.

3. Todo Listing: The application displays all the created todos organized, allowing users to have an overview of their tasks.

4. Todo Editing: Users have the ability to edit existing todos whenever needed. They can modify the title or description of any task directly from the interface, ensuring flexibility in managing their todos.

5. Todo Completion: Once a task is completed, users can mark it as done within the application.

6. Todo Deletion: If a user no longer needs a particular todo or wants to declutter their list, they can easily delete any task from the interface with just one click.
